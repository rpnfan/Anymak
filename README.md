Anymak END -- multi-lingual keyboard layout â‡’ E = English, N = Nederlands, D = Deutsch 
  END = final destination of my keyboard layout journey :-)
 Umlauts, Trema and accents needed for German and Dutch are easily accesible (only 2 keystrokes needed), 
    while French and Spanish are also supported as second priority language,
    accents  ~ ` ^ realized as dead keys on symbol layer (3 key strokes needed).
  
 Anymak includes two additional non-standard layers:
   - Navigation layer on the space-key (space-fn), including shortcuts like copy/ paste and
     easy to reach positions for Enter, Backspace, Delete, Insert and more
   - an extra character layer for symbols and umlauts and more
 
 To use the layout activate the "US International" keyboard layout in Windows.
    (Linux and MacOS should work the same, but not tested, let me know if that works without changes).

Can be used with a programmable keyboard. Here a Kanata configuration is provided to be used with any keyboard (even laptops).
