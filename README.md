*Anymak* is a keyboard layout approach designed to largely enhance typing comfort. By  rearranging keys, and utilizing one-shot modifiers and bottom-row mods, *Anymak* makes it easier to access common keys like Shift, symbols and navigation shortcuts, while minimizing finger stretching. It maintains consistent key positions across both standard and ergonomic split keyboards. As a versatile keymap approach, *Anymak* is compatible with various layouts, allowing you to continue using QWERTY, Colemak, or any other layout you prefer. I myself use the *Anymak* concept with a fully optimized multi-language character layout, specifically designed for English, German, Dutch, and other European languages.  It is named anymak:END and probably also the last layout you might need.

The Anymak concept can be applied to any alphanumeric or language layout. A ready-to-run software implementation in Kanata for anymak:END can be downloaded here and works on Windows, Linux and macOS.

Read the [detailed article](https://kbd.news/Anymak-the-compatible-ergonomic-keyboard-layout-2574.html) why this setup was chosen. This will likely help you to choose or create your own personal "best" solution.

# anymak:END — multi-lingual keyboard layout
END stands for ⇒ E = English, N = Nederlands, D = Deutsch

It also marks the final destination of my keyboard layout journey :-)

 
 Umlauts, Trema and accents needed for German and Dutch are easily accesible (only 2 keystrokes needed), 
    while French and Spanish are also supported as second priority language,
    accents  ~ ` ^ realized as dead keys on symbol layer (3 key strokes needed).
  
 Anymak includes two additional non-standard layers:
   - Navigation layer on the space-key (space-fn concept), including shortcuts like copy/ paste and
     easy to reach positions for Enter, Backspace, Delete, Insert and more
   - an extra character layer for symbols and umlauts and more
 
Can be used with a programmable keyboard or a software solution. To be able to test or directly use the layout with any keyboard (even laptops) I offer a Kanata configuration file. Just extract kanata (kanata_gui for Windows) and the config in the same folder and run kanata. To use the layout activate the "US International" keyboard layout in Windows. (Linux and MacOS should work the same, but not tested, let me know if that works without changes). For macOS and Linux download Kanata from Github.
